    fullDescription: "Chemical peels are a popular aesthetic treatment that involves applying a chemical solution to the skin, causing it to exfoliate and eventually peel off. This process reveals new, smoother skin underneath. Chemical peels can be used to treat wrinkles, skin discoloration, and scars. They can be done at different depths — light, medium, or deep — depending on your desired results and recovery time.",
